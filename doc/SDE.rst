SDE Apparatus
=================

.. attention::
  
  1. Do not use the temperature measurement of the right heater for adjusting temperature;
  
  2. Do use the "cycle" and "snow" buttons on the panel of the cooling system;
  
  3. Do not open the vaccum pump when the extraction flask is not boiling;
  
  4. Do open the heater to heat the flask with extraction agent;
  
  5. Do not close the vaccum pump while the while system does not cool down;

1. 注意加入沐浴露到烧杯之后，千万一定要搅拌均匀，因为有机和水不混溶;

2. Please pay attention to the vaccum device when using rotating vaporisation machine. Because when the vaccumn device is off, there will be bubbles coming up from the bottom of the tank:

3. When the vaccumn device is on, see what happened:

Properties
===============

1. The latent heat of condensation of pentane is 335 kJ/kg;

2. Pentane(n-): Its thermal conductivity value is 0.135 W/m*K. And it is recoommended over the tempeerature limit-303 K;

3. Water: Its thermal conductivity value is 0.57 W/m*K. And it is recoomended over the temperature limit-273K;

4. For water at 373 K, the latent heat of vaporisation is 2257 kJ/kg;

5. For pentane at 313 K, the latent heat of vaporisation is 180 kJ/kg;

6. Use the following chart for searching latent-of-heat;

If the volume of extractant is smaller than 1 ml or 0.5 ml, you can use the pentane or dichlormethane to increase the volume of the extractant and then concentrate it either by air dry or by rotating vapourisation techiques. 


SDE vs SPME
------------

1. SPME was more efficient in extracting low molecular weight and high volatility compounds;
2. SDE was able to extract compounds with low volatilities that were not extracted using SPME;
3. the ratio between some compounds from lipid oxidation and those from degradation of amino acids was much lower in SDE extracts than with SPME, which could be a consequence of the development of Strecker degradation of amino acids during distillation in SDE owing to the high temperatures used;
4. Similarly, diunsaturated aldehydes detected in SDE extracts were absent using SPME, probably owing to oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in SDE as a consequence of the temperature during extraction;
