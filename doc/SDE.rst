SDE Apparatus
=================

.. attention::
  
  1. Do not use the temperature measurement of the right heater for adjusting temperature;
  
  2. Do use the "cycle" and "snow" buttons on the panel of the cooling system;
  
  3. Do not open the vaccum pump when the extraction flask is not boiling;
  
  4. Do open the heater to heat the flask with extraction agent;
  
  5. Do not close the vaccum pump while the while system does not cool down;

1. 注意加入沐浴露到烧杯之后，千万一定要搅拌均匀，因为有机和水不混溶;

2. Please pay attention to the vaccum device when using rotating vaporisation machine. Because when the vaccumn device is off, there will be bubbles coming up from the bottom of the tank:

Properties
===============

1. The latent heat of condensation of pentane is 335 kJ/kg;

2. Pentane(n-): Its thermal conductivity value is 0.135 W/m*K. And it is recoommended over the tempeerature limit-303 K;

3. Water: Its thermal conductivity value is 0.57 W/m*K. And it is recoomended over the temperature limit-273K;

4. For water at 373 K, the latent heat of vaporisation is 2257 kJ/kg;

5. For pentane at 313 K, the latent heat of vaporisation is 180 kJ/kg;
